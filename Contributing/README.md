This guide is intended to help contributors with two things:
1. Obtain a conceptual, high-level understanding of Agorex-io and the components
necessary for its operation. 
2. Understand the technologies behind these components, and where new developers can learn the technologies. 
3. Learn the guidelines and best practices for contributing to Agorex-io.

If you're here for a specific question regarding contributing, see if it's already been answered in the [contribution FAQ](#contribution-faq), otherwise [open an issue](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Cooperative/issues) with the _question_ label.

If you're a developer who has worked on a similar project before, then your insights into 
what was easy or difficult for you pick up will be incredibly helpful for the developers who
haven't been exposed to these technologies. 

Your feedback and contributions to this README.md in the 
form of links, tutorials, and/or the tips and tricks that you've picked up along the way would be
incredibly helpful and more than welcome. 

# Getting Started
## Etherium Blockchain
If you don't already understand the concept behind the Etherium blockchain, then it's essential that 
you grasp it before moving forward. 

If you like to sit back and read in-depth explinations of concepts, then I recommend starting with the [Etherium whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper).

If you'd prefer a more consise overview of the _important parts_, checkout ["Just Enough Bitcoin for Ethereum."](https://media.consensys.net/time-sure-does-fly-ed4518792679) **More good 'overview' tutorial links and a video alternative needed**
