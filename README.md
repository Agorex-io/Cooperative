# Agorex - Cooperative Decentralized Exchange
Our official mission statement is currently pending. 

This statment, along with the goals, [future](##Road-map), and [members](##Members) of Agorex-io are to be determined by the Agorex-io cooperative.  

## Name
Agorex, the Cooperative Decentralized Exchange!

So, what exactly does "Agorex" mean?

Agorex is a combination of two words: Agora & Exchange.

An "Agora" was a "public, open space used for assemblies and markets" in ancient Greece.

As an added bonus "Agora" also means "Now" in Portuguese!

We believe this name represents our core values of providing a public, open, honest, community-run decentralized exchange.

## Road-map 
The following road-map is an inital rough draft of Agorex-io's road-map as laid out by [JonathonDunford](https://github.com/JonathonDunford). It is **greatly in need of review** from the Agorex-io cooperative members, as it determines the next steps that will be taken by Agorex-io. No road-map or decisions will be made without the majority of the cooperative in agreement.

The following items may be elaborated on with their own road-maps, this is simply a high-level overview of steps that may need to be taken.


1. ~~Finish deciding on a name for the project.~~
- ~~This then includes purchasing proper domain names and securing official social media channels.~~
- ~~Then, a Google suite organization should be created so that all members of the team can share access to files and important information as well as have an official email.~~

2. Finalize "XIP-1", see issue #1 in Proposals **Current Item**
- This would set up proper procedures for proposals and edits to the project in the future. This would be our guidelines for how to proceed.

3. Finalize "XIP-2", see issue #2 in Proposals
- This would finalize the structure of the organization and determine which democratic legal entity would be set up. This would also define the guidelines for how that new entity should run.

4. Set up a DAO / Coop as defined in "XIP-2".

5. Get official logo and branding.

6. Look for funding from other DAOs / Coops if necessary.

7. Get legal counsel. [JonathonDunford](https://github.com/JonathonDunford) can share the contacts and information garnered from previous experience with ForkDelta.

8. Research different methods of revenue generation without trade fees and compile the options / proposal into "XIP-3". Technologies like "Oyster Pearl" could be used.

9. Research 0x versus our newly built smart contract. Weigh the pros and cons and develop an "XIP" for which to use going forward.

10. Finish a new UI complete with: ?

11. Go through listing issues / requests / delist request.
Possibly go through every token previously listed. This would be the time to go through and remove "bad" tokens BEFORE a launch.

12. Deploy 0x/smart contract solution. If smart contract, we need a security audit.

13. Deploy backend solution.

14. Develop marketing plans for "beta" and launch.

15. Launch "alpha" version of the xchange. No real marketing for this. This will allow people that already know of the project to get on and test the exchange. It could provide a good platform for stress testing and performance benchmarks. The alpha test should focus on exposing bugs within the system. Proper bug reporting platforms need to be prominent.

16. Launch "beta" version of the exchange. This is where some marketing would come into play. This should be an elevated stress test. The beta test should focus on exposing possible bottlenecks and performance issues in the system under load.

17. Launch v1.0 of the exchange.

18. Develop future growth plans for the exchange.

19. Develop plans for further decentralization of the exchange.

20. Add support for decentralized trading on RChain's blockchain technology. **May have a much higher precedence than current road-map order**
