## Name
**Agorex, the Cooperative Decentralized Exchange**

> So, what exactly does "Agorex" mean?

Agorex is a combination of two words: _Agora_ & _Exchange_.

An [_Agora_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) was a _"public, open space used for assemblies and markets"_ in ancient Greece.

As an added bonus _Agora_ also means _"Now"_ in Portuguese!

We believe this name represents our core values of providing a **public**, **open**, **honest**, **community-run decentralized exchange**.


## Contribute
We are a group who have worked on a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange before. We want the community, like the technology, to also be decentralized. So we are building a community-run decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that puts the community in charge. To see how we put the community in charge of the direction of the exchange, see our proposal process. We also plan to set up a cooperative organization where contributors who want to make a more significant contribution can literally operate and manage the exchange on behalf of the community.

### _How?_
You can contribute by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GVuj6UY) and offering your ideas, insights, and advice on how to build an public, open, honest community around a decentralized exchange. You can contribute with your insights on all aspects of a community-run decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. Including technology, business/legal, economics, community building, documentation. And of course, we :heart: pull requests from designers and developers too!

We're currently accepting potential members for our cooperative in the #offers-to-help channel. 
We do not have any formal way of joining the coop or a current standard KYC process set up yet, however, we are definitely looking for people who are interested in joining the coop and helping with everything from development to marketing to community management.

**If you're interested in becoming a part of this early stage of the coop, please drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GVuj6UY) and share the following:**
- Why you'd like to be a part of the Coop that will be formed.
- What are your strengths?
- What can you provide to the Coop?
- What experience do you have?
- What is your full name?
- (optional) provide a LinkedIn profile
- (optional) provide your GitHub profile 

## Milestones
An official list of milestones is currently pending [dissucsion](https://discord.gg/GVuj6UY). Below is a very high level overview of what we seek to accomplish.

## Members
We maintain the list of our ever-growing list of contributors [here](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Cooperative/tree/membership-list/membership). 

## AIP Proposals
We intend for [Agorex Improvement Proposals (AIPs)](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Proposals) to be the primary mechanisms for the community to propose new processes, raise issues, and collect community input on processes and issues. AIPs serve as the official documentation for the the processes that the Board of Directors executes on behalf of the community. Because the AIPs are maintained as text files in a [versioned repository](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Proposals/tree/master/proposals), their revision history is the historical record of the proposal.

Inspired by [Etherium's Improvement Proposal 1 (EIP-1)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md), our [AIP-1](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Proposals/blob/master/proposals/aip-1.md) is the initial AIP that establishes the guidelines of all future AIPs.
