## Name
**Agorex, the Cooperative Decentralized Exchange**

> So, what exactly does "Agorex" mean?

Agorex is a combination of two words: _Agora_ & _Exchange_.

An [_Agora_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora) was a _"public, open space used for assemblies and markets"_ in ancient Greece.

As an added bonus _Agora_ also means _"Now"_ in Portuguese!

We believe this name represents our core values of providing a **public**, **open**, **honest**, **community-run decentralized exchange**.


## Contribute
We are a group who have experience with decentralized exchanges. We want the community, like the technology, to also be decentralized. So, we are building a community-run decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that puts the community in charge. [Agorex Improvement Proposals (AIPs)](https://github.com/Agorex-io/Proposals) are the primary mechanisms for the community to propose new processes, raise issues, and collect community input on processes and issues. AIPs serve as the official documentation for the processes that the Board of Directors executes on behalf of the community. Additionally, we have set up a cooperative organization where contributors who want to make a more significant contribution can literally operate and manage the exchange on behalf of the community.

### _How?_
You can contribute by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GVuj6UY) and offering your ideas, insights, and advice on how to build a public, open, honest community around a decentralized exchange.

And of course, we :heart: pull requests from designers and developers too!
